    <h4>Free, beginner-friendly coding classes for over 3000 women in DC</h4>

  </div>

  <h2>Hear Me Code offered classes from September 2013 to September 2019.</h2>

  <h3>In that time, we held over 150 classes and over 3500 women had a beginner-friendly introduction to coding in Python.</h3>

  <h3>Hundreds of women started as students to become teaching assistant and teachers; dozens have credited Hear Me Code with providing them the skills and experience they needed to land their first tech job.</h3>

  <h3>While we no longer offer in-person classes, <a href="https://github.com/hearmecode/slides">all of our resources are freely available</a> for anyone to learn on their own.</h3>

  <hr>

  <h4>Thank you all for being part of the Hear Me Code community. Over the last six years, I think we've built something really special.</h4>

  <h4>A community where thousands of women took their first steps in learning how to code; a supportive environment where we could help one another learn and grow; where so many have landed a tech job or promotion, thanks in part to the skills and experience gained here.</h4>

  <h4>You may have noticed that we've been running fewer classes than usual. The reality is it's gotten much harder to secure suitable venues than it was in the past. It's not just venues though. Logistically, keeping everything moving takes a lot of time I simply don't have anymore.</h4>

  <h4>In short: we'll no longer be running classes. Our slides and materials will continue to remain available for anyone to use.</h4>

  <h4>What is Hear Me Code without monthly classes? Well, that's up to you. Right now, it's a community of 3500 incredibly talented folks. I hope you make the most of it; I want to think I planted the seeds of something bigger than what we see now.</h4>

  <h4>Am I designating a successor? No. Why not? Running a group like this is not sustainable. But perhaps the group will adapt and shift. People used to informally organize study groups and get together pretty often! Maybe you'll start doing it again.</h4>

  <h4>For now, I especially want to thank the hundreds of you who have given your time as teaching assistants and teachers, passing on what you've learned and helping others to grow. You are the backbone of this group, and I'm so, so very grateful to you.</h4>

  <h4>Thank you all for being a part of this journey. It's been a joy to grow with you all.</h4>

  <h4>&mdash; Shannon</h4>
