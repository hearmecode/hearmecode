<h1>A Major Milestone</h1>

<h3>August 21, 2017</h3>

<p class="story">When I first started teaching free coding classes with just four women around my kitchen table in September 2013, I never imagined what would come next.</p>

<p class="story">In just under four years, we've grown to 3000 members. For the first eight months, I taught every single class using the curriculum I developed. As the group grew, we outgrew my apartment and I knew I'd need more teachers, too.</p>

<p class="story">So I focused on turning those early students into teaching assistants and eventually into teachers. After all, teaching is one of the best ways to learn. It forces you to think flexibly and to find many ways to explain something. Coding itself is difficult, teaching coding is still more challenging, and teaching coding to beginners is on another level.</p>

<p class="story">And the Hear Me Code community has risen to that challenge. Over 100 women started as students before becoming teachers and teaching assistants. For many women, this is the first time they've taught or done public speaking.</p>

<p class="story">In almost four years, we've run over 100 classes, giving members a beginner-friendly introduction to coding. By the end of three lessons, they've gained a solid foundation of key concepts -- the essential building blocks they need to begin working on projects.</p>

<p class="story">Dozens of women have credited Hear Me Code with giving them the skills and experience they needed to land a better-paying job in tech.</p>

<img src="hmc_20161210.png" class="img-responsive text-center img-center" alt="Class at Hear Me Code" title="Class at Hear Me Code">

<p class="story">For me, Hear Me Code has been a labor of love. It's an all-volunteer effort, and I've done all of this in addition to my day job. I don't get paid. Nobody does. It really is like a second full time job for me building the curriculum, coordinating venues, training teachers, mentoring students, and running the admin side -- and always refining, iterating, adjusting, fine-tuning, and improving little by little.</p>

<p class="story">But I haven't done it all by myself. Hear Me Code would not be possible without the teachers who give their time practicing for their lessons. Hear Me Code wouldn't be the same without teaching assistants, ready to swoop in to help. Hear Me Code could never grow without the support of community partners who host our classes on the weekends. To all of you who have given their time and talent to the Hear Me Code community, I am so grateful.</p>

<p class="story">I never imagined any of this would be possible. It's been an incredible journey these four years, and I hope the community continues to thrive for a long time to come.</p>

<p class="story">So as Hear Me Code passes this major milestone, I'd like to celebrate how far we've come. I want to celebrate all we've accomplished. I want to celebrate our vibrant community and all of the incredible women I've met along the way.</p>

<p class="story">Here are some of my favorite Hear Me Code memories and greatest hits you may have missed:</p>

<li class="story">Giving away 100 paperbacks, ebooks, and video tutorials for <a href="https://hellowebbooks.com/order/#original" target="_blank">Hello Web App</a> to Hear Me Code members and attendees of the 2016 Tech Lady Hackathon</li>

</ul>

<p class="story">I'd love to hear your favorite memories, too. Please share them on Twitter and tag <a href="https://twitter.com/hearmecode" target="_blank">@hearmecode</a>!</p>

<p class="story">So once again, to all the students, teaching assistants, teachers, venues, hosts, volunteers, and supporters over the years -- thank you so much for being part of this. I'm so grateful to you all.</p>
